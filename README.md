# Third-Party-API-Schedule
## Project Description
This project challenges us to use Jquery and third party API's like day.js. My motivation behind this assignment was to carefully structure before coding. I had to find out how to grab different childs in the parent node.  I built this project so I can understand how to use local storage and formatting it with jquery.   The problem this challenge solves is that I can see the value of using if, else if, and else, inside of function for local storage. I learned how to grab css. My project stands out because I tried my best to make it the most efficient line of code.
